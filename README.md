# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview: 
Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations, such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans.
Minimizing the risk of default is a major concern for financial institutions. For this reason, financial institutions are increasingly relying on technology to predict which clients are more prone to stop honoring their debts.
Machine Learning models have been helping these companies to improve the accuracy of their credit risk analysis, providing a scientific method to identify potential debtors in advance.
Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on to reject fradulent applications.
To complete this analysis, we use different Machine Learning techniques to train and evaluate the data with unbalanced classes. 
The dataset from the LendingClub has an unbalanced classification problem due to the number of good loans outweighing the amount of risky loans. 
In order balance out the classifications to allow for more meaningful predictions and improve the accuracy score, we needed to employ various Machine Learning algorithms to resample the data. 
These algorithms include RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
